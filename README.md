# TeamStats
Original description: TeamStats is a Java program that displays tables, matches and statistics from a league in some sport. 
You can also select two teams and compare them in a number of ways. TeamStats is primarily developed for soccer but can also 
be used with other sports such as ice-hockey, handball etc

Due to a request on [java-forums.org](http://www.java-forums.org/java-applets/96419-how-can-i-get-old-applet-work.html), this project has been revived, with permission from Mats Bovin himself.

# History
This is an old applet, originally developed by Mats Bovin, back in 1996 (96-09-22, Version 1 Beta 1 ). Using WaybackMachine, 
it was possible to dig up the original sourcecode for the applet

# Java 1.0.2
The program was originally developed as an applet, using Java 1.0.2. After renaming variables "enum" to "enumeration" due to the keyword change in Java 5, 
the code compiled with Java 8 and actually ran like a charm using AppletViewer. Personally, I find that amazing. That's 20 years of language development, and the code 
still compiles and runs without modification (besides the enum-thing ofcourse).

# Goals
The goal of this project is make the applet usable as a standalone propgram. After that, possibily port this program to current UI standards, using JavaFX.
