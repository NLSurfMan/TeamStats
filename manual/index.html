<H3>What is TeamStats?</H3>
<P>TeamStats is a Java-applet that displays tables, matches and statistics
from a league in some sport. You can also select two teams and compare
them in a number of ways. TeamStats is primarily developed for soccer but
can also be used with other sports such as ice-hockey.
<P>It's also possible for anyone to make a league available on the web using TeamStats (that's probably the reason why you have downloaded this file). If you don't want to present your own league on the web you can visit <A HREF="http://www.mbovin.com/ts/index.html">TeamStats homepage</A> and see which leagues are available there.

<H3>What is needed to present a league on the Web using TeamStats?</H3>
<P>Not much. Obviously you need the possibility to display HTML-documents
on the Web. You don't need to have Java installed on your computer
or access to CGI-scripts. You don't need any knowledge of Java or
of programming. You only need some very basic HTML knowledge. Once the
program is installed the only work you have to do is to update the file
that contains the matches. TeamStats works just as fine with lower divisions
and amateur leagues as it does with the higher pro leagues.

<H3>What does it cost to use TeamStats to present a league on the Web?</H3>
<P>TeamStats is distributed under the <a href="gpl.txt">GNU General Public License</a>. That means you can use TeamStats for <b>free</b> on your web site.
