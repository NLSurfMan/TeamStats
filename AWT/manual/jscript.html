<H2>Control TeamStats via JavaScript</H2>

<P>This document describes the functions that can be used to control TeamStats
via JavaScript. It's presumed that the reader has some knowledge of JavaScript.
Anyone who wants to learn more about JavaScript can try <A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/eng/mozilla/3.0/handbook/javascript/index.html">Netscape's
JavaScript pages</A> or this <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Programming_Languages/JavaScript/">link collection</A>. Don't worry if you're not interested in this or think
it's to complicated. This is an 'extra' feature and it's not necessary
to neither understand nor use it.

<P>The first thing you need to do is to give the Applet a name so you can
refer to it in your JavaScript code:

<PRE>&lt;APPLET&nbsp;CODE=&quot;embe.ts.TeamStats.class&quot; NAME=&quot;TeamStats&quot; WIDTH=560 HEIGHT=480&gt;
                                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ </PRE>

<P>When you want to call a function you write like this:

<PRE>document.TeamStats.functionName()</PRE>

<P>You don't have to use the name &quot;TeamStats&quot;, any name will
do. At the moment TeamStats has the following functions.

<H3>setLeaguefile(String filename)</H3>

<P>This function is used to tell TeamStats to load and show a new league.
The only argument it takes is the name of the <A HREF="params.html#leaguefile">parameterfile</A>
that contains the league information. A function call can look like this:

<PRE>document.TeamStats.setLeaguefile('myleagueargs.txt')</PRE>

<P>By using this function you can use one Applet to display several different
leagues. <A HREF="example5.html">Here</A> and <A HREF="example6.html">here</A>
are examples of how it might look.

<H3>loadLeaguefile(String filename)</H3>

<P>Works in the same way as <TT>setLeaguefile()</TT> with the difference
that the new league is not displayed. It's downloaded in the background. <A HREF="example8.html">This</A> is an example of <TT>loadLeaguefile()</TT>.

<H3>showTable(int matches, int rounds, int number)</H3>

<P>The function makes TeamStats show Table-mode. The arguments that the
function take corresponds to the settings you make in the menus in Table-mode.
All arguments should be integers and they have the following meaning:

<DL>
<DT><B>int matches</B>
<DD>0 = all matches, 1 = home matches, 2 = away matches
<DT><B>int rounds</B>
<DD>0 = all, 1 = first, 2 = last
<DT><B>int number</B>
<DD>The number of matches to show when first or last is selected
</DL>

<P>If you give an invalid value the setting will not change. Examples of
<TT>showTable()</TT>:

<P>Show table without changing any settings:<BR>
<TT>document.TeamStats.showTable(-1, -1, -1)</TT>

<P>Show the current table:<BR>
<TT>document.TeamStats.showTable(0, 0, -1)</TT>

<P>Show table of the last ten matches:<BR>
<TT>document.TeamStats.showTable(0, 2, 10)</TT>

<P>Show table of the six first home matches:<BR>
<TT>document.TeamStats.showTable(1, 1, 6)</TT>

<H3>showMatches(string team, int matches, int result)</H3>

<P>Shows Match-mode. The arguments of the function are as follow:

<DL>
<DT><B>string team</B>
<DD>The name of the team whose matches are to be shown. The
name has to be exactly the same as the name used in the matchfile. If you
want to show all matches use the string 'All'.
<DT><B>int matches</B>
<DD>0 = all matches, 1 = home matches, 2 = away matches
<DT><B>int result</B>
<DD>0 = all, 1 = won, 2 = drawn, 3 = lost
</DL>

<P>Examples:

<P>Show matches without changing any settings:<BR>
<TT>document.TeamStats.showMatches(' ', -1, -1)</TT>

<P>Show all matches:<BR>
<TT>document.TeamStats.showMatches('All', -1, -1)</TT>

<P>Show all Leeds home matches:<BR>
<TT>document.TeamStats.showMatches('Leeds', 1, 0)</TT>

<P>Show Aston Villas away losses:<BR>
<TT>document.TeamStats.showMatches('Aston Villa', 2, 3)</TT>

<H3>showStats()</H3>

<P>Shows Statistics-mode. The function has no arguments. Example:<BR>

<TT>document.TeamStats.showStats()</TT>

<H3>showCompare(int mode, string hometeam, string awayteam)</H3>

<P>Shows Compare-mode. The arguments of the function are as follow:

<DL>
<DT><B>int mode</B>
<DD>0 = statistics, 1 = home/away stats, 2 = previous matches
<DT><B>string hometeam</B>
<DD>The name of the hometeam
<DT><B>string awayteam</B>
<DD>The name of the awayteam
</DL>

<P>Examples:

<P>Show compare without changing any settings:<BR>
<TT>document.TeamStats.showCompare(-1, ' ', ' ')</TT>

<P>Show statistics between Derby and Everton:<BR>
<TT>document.TeamStats.showCompare(0, 'Derby', 'Everton')</TT>

<P>Show previous matches between West Ham and Arsenal:<BR>
<TT>document.TeamStats.showCompare(2, 'West Ham', 'Arsenal')</TT>

<P><A HREF="example7.html">Here</A> is another example of how you can use
<TT>showCompare()</TT>.

<H3>Comments</H3>

<P>If you try to call a TeamStats-function before the Applet has finished
loading some strange results may occur. A way to protect yourself from
this is to have a boolean variable that is first set to <TT>false</TT> and then
changed to <TT>true</TT> in the <TT>onLoad</TT>-event in &lt;BODY&gt;. The variable is then
checked before any function is called. You can se how it works if you study
the code of <A HREF="example7.html">this page</A>.

<P>The use of these functions may vary. The examples given here are just
some of the possibilities that exists. The thought behind these functions
is that they should provide a way to integrate TeamStats with the rest
of the information available. If you, for instance, have pages with information
about each team in the league you can have a link that runs TeamStats and
shows the matches of the team. It's pretty much up to each and everyone
to figure out how to use these functions in the best way.
