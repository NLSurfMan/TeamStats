TeamStats</H1>

<H2>Brief manual</H2>

<P>The program has four main functions:

<UL>
<LI>Table
<LI>Matches
<LI>Statistics
<LI>Compare teams
</UL>

<H3>Table</H3>

<P>You decide how the table will be displayed by changing the table settings.
In the box <B>Matches </B>you can decide if the table should be a home,
away or total table. In the <B>Rounds </B>box you decide if the table should
be over all, the first or the last rounds. If you choose first or last
you can also enter the number of rounds. A table over the five last rounds
is a good way to compare the form of the teams. You can also combine the
settings for <B>Matches </B>and <B>Rounds </B>and for example display a
table over the five last home matches. To show the current table just select
<I>All </I>in both <B>Matches </B>and <B>Rounds</B>.

<H3>Matches</H3>

<P>The list with matches is displayed backwards, with the most recent match at the top. You can either see all the played matches or select a team and see only
the matches of that team. To see all the matches you select <I>All </I>in
the <B>Team </B>box. If you select a team you can then select if you want
to see all, home or away matches in the <B>Matches </B>box. In the <B>Results
</B>box you select if you want to see won, drawn or lost matches. When
you have selected a team the matches will be displayed in a different format.
After the opponents name you see an (H) or an (A). (H) means that the selected
team played home and (A) that they played away. The result that follows
is always displayed with the selected teams goals first regardless of if they
played home or away.

<H3>Statistics</H3>

<P>Here you can see some miscellaneous stats from the league. Hopefully
it's quite self-explanatory.

<H3>Compare teams</H3>

<P>In this section you can select two teams and compare their stats prior
to a match between them. You select the teams in the boxes <B>Hometeam
</B>and <B>Awayteam</B>. In the field above the team boxes you select if
you want to see <I>Statistics</I>, <I>Home/away stats</I> or <I>Previous
matches</I>.

<P>In <I>Statistics</I> you first see some information about the table position,
played matches and goalstats etc. Then the five last matches are displayed.
The most recent match is showed at the top of the list. In Current streaks
you can see if the teams have any streaks running. For example a team can
have played five matches in a row without losing or without scoring a goal.
At the bottom the teams most frequent results are displayed.

<P>In <I>Home/away stats</I> the same information as in Statistics are
showed, limited to home- and awayresults. Facts about the home team are only
based on their home matches and the other way around for the away team.

<P>In <I>Previous matches</I> the results from previous matches between
the two teams are shown.
