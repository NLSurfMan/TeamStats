TeamStats</H1>

<H2>The program</H2>

<P>The program consists of a number of Java class-files. These files <B>must</B>
be placed in a directory named <TT>ts</TT> (except the files <TT>HyperLink.class</TT>, <TT>ModeButton.class</TT> and <TT>ModePanel.class</TT> who go into the <TT>ui</TT> directory). The <TT>ts</TT> and <TT>ui</TT> directories
<B>must</B> be placed in a directory named <TT>embe</TT>. The <TT>embe</TT> directory
can be placed anywhere. The <TT>embe</TT>, <TT>ts</TT> and <TT>ui</TT> directories
should be created automatically when you unzip the zip-file. If they aren't
you can create the directories manually.

<PRE>Example of directories:  c:/program/TeamStats/embe/ts
                         c:/embe/ts
                         /home/bob/embe/ts</PRE>

<H2>The HTML-document</H2>

<P>To insert TeamStats in a HTML-document you use the APPLET-tag. It has
the following syntax:

<PRE>&lt;APPLET CODEBASE=&quot;URL to code&quot; CODE=&quot;appletfile&quot; WIDTH=&quot;pixels&quot; HEIGHT=&quot;pixels&quot;&gt;
&lt;PARAM NAME=&quot;parametername1&quot; VALUE=&quot;parametervalue&quot;&gt;
&lt;PARAM NAME=&quot;parametername2&quot; VALUE=&quot;parametervalue&quot;&gt;
...
&lt;/APPLET&gt;</PRE>

<P>There are more attributes available to the APPLET-tag. Anyone interested
can find them <A HREF="http://www.w3c.org/TR/REC-html32.html#applet">here</A>.

<H4>CODEBASE</H4>

<P>Optional attribute that states where the program is placed. In the TeamStats case it is the URL to the directory that contains the <TT>embe</TT> directory.
The URL can be given relatively to the HTML-documents URL, for example
CODEBASE=&quot;../program&quot;. If this attribute is missing the URL to
the HTML-document is used to locate the code. That means that the <TT>embe</TT> directory
is assumed to be in the same directory as the HTML-document.

<H4>CODE</H4>

<P>Required attribute that gives the name of the file to execute. The value
of this attribute <B>must</B> be CODE=&quot;embe.ts.TeamStats.class&quot;.

<H4>WIDTH</H4>

<P>Gives the width of the Applet. The value should be WIDTH=560.

<H4>HEIGHT</H4>

<P>Gives the height of the Applet. The value should be HEIGHT=480.

<H4>PARAM</H4>

<P>This attribute is used to give parameters to TeamStats. The word PARAM
is followed by NAME and then the name of the parameter you want to set.
Then you write VALUE and the value of the parameter. In TeamStats some parameters can
be set several times, for example <TT>LineX</TT>. Just replace the 'X' with a number
that is increased every time you use the parameter. The first parameter will be <TT>Line1</TT>, the next
one <TT>Line2</TT> and so on.

<P><A HREF="params.html">Here are all the parameters</A> that can be set.

<H2>Use archive-files to speed up applet loading</H2>

<P>One reason for slow loading speed is that most applets consists of several
files. TeamStats, for instance, consists of 15 different files that are
transferred across the net one at a time. The solution to this problem is to place all the applet-files
in an archive and then transfer the archive. Unfortunately the two major
browsers (Navigator and Internet Explorer) support different archive types.
Navigator uses Zip-files while IE uses Microsoft's
own Cabinet fileformat (CAB). However it is possible to combine the
two methods and thereby ensure that the applet is transferred as quickly
as possible.

<P>Both Zip- and Cab-versions of the program are included in TeamStats.
They are named <TT>ts.zip</TT> and <TT>ts.cab</TT> and are placed in the <TT>embe</TT> directory.
<B>Don't</B> unpack these files. It's okay to move the files to another
location.

<H3>Netscape Navigator and Zip-files</H3>

<P>You use the ARCHIVE-attribute in the APPLET-tag to give the location
of the Zip-file. If <TT>ts.zip</TT> is in the <TT>embe</TT> directory it will look like this:

<PRE>&lt;APPLET CODE=&quot;embe.ts.TeamStats.class&quot; ARCHIVE=&quot;embe/ts.zip&quot; WIDTH=560 HEIGHT=480&gt;</PRE>

<P>Navigator will now load the entire program in one transfer instead of
in several. It's important to leave the 'standard' class-files where they
are. They will be used by browsers who don't understand the ARCHIVE-attribute
or if something is wrong with the Zip-file.

<H3>MS Internet Explorer and Cab-files</H3>

<P>In the APPLET-tag you use &lt;PARAM NAME=cabbase&gt; to give the location
of the Cab-file. If <TT>ts.cab</TT> is placed in the <TT>embe</TT> directory it will look
like this:

<PRE>&lt;APPLET CODE=&quot;embe.ts.TeamStats.class&quot; WIDTH=560 HEIGHT=480&gt;
&lt;PARAM NAME=cabbase VALUE=&quot;embe/ts.cab&quot;&gt;</PRE>

<H3>Combining the two methods</H3>

<P>The best solution is to combine the two methods and thereby ensuring
optimal download performance. It can look like this:

<PRE>&lt;APPLET CODE=&quot;embe.ts.TeamStats.class&quot; ARCHIVE=&quot;embe/ts.zip&quot; WIDTH=560 HEIGHT=480&gt;
&lt;PARAM NAME=cabbase VALUE=&quot;embe/ts.cab&quot;&gt;</PRE>

<P>The two browsers can now use their own method to load the program. Once
again note that the 'standard' class-files <B>not</B> should be removed.

<P>Note that this not is a TeamStats feature, it can be used with
any Java-applet.
