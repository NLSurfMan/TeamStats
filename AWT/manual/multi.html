<H2>Using TeamStats with multiple leagues</H2>

<H3>Loading additional leagues</H3>

<P>As of v1.03 you can use TeamStats with multiple leagues at the same
time. You don't have to put different leagues on different pages. To load
additional leagues into TeamStats (aside from the one given in the Applet-tag)
you use the JavaScript-functions <TT>setLeaguefile()</TT> and <TT>loadLeaguefile()</TT>.
<TT>setLeaguefile()</TT> first downloads the league and then displays it.
Because the league data is transported across the net there is a small
delay before the league is displayed. If the league already has been downloaded
it will be displayed immediately. <TT>loadLeagufile()</TT> will download
the league in the background without displaying it. To display the league
you have to use <TT>setLeaguefile()</TT>. <TT>loadLeaguefile()</TT> can
be used in the <TT>onLoad</TT>-event in the BODY-tag to automatically download leagues
when the page is loaded. More information on JavaScript-functions is available
<A HREF="jscript.html">here</A>.

<H3>Show meetings from previous seasons</H3>

<P>When you display <I>Previous matches</I> in <I>Compare teams</I> TeamStats
will automatically look through the leagues that have been loaded and try
to find meetings from previous seasons. In order for this to work the teams
have to have the exact same names in the different leagues. It's also important
that the parameters <TT>LeagueName</TT> and <TT>Season</TT> are set so it's clear in what
league the meeting occurred. The leagues are sorted according to the value
of the <TT>Season</TT> parameter. So it's important to be consistent when using
this parameter. It doesn't matter what format you use (1996/97, 96-97,
1997 etc) as long as you use the same format. Don't use 1995/96 one season
and 96-97 the next.

<P>Note that TeamStats will go through <I>all</I> the loaded leagues looking
for previous meetings. That means that if you have two leagues with nothing
in common but with teams with the same names TeamStats will display these
matches as previous meetings. To prevent this you can use the <TT>NoPrevSeason</TT>
parameter. If you set it to &quot;True&quot; TeamStats will not look for
matches from previous seasons.
